## Dataset Hosted on [Data.world](http://data.world/)

The Product Hunt dataset (and info about the dataset) is hosted on [this data.world repo](https://data.world/producthunt/product-hunt-research). I contribute my finished work to that data.world repo, but I maintain my _working_ repo here in `git`.

Each Jupyter notebook below answers one or more questions about the Product Hunt dataset. Each notebook is self-contained and can be run (and read) top-to-bottom if you care about the details.
